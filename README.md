# Multithreaded Sorting Application

# Description
Write a multithreaded sorting program that works as follows: A list of integers is divided into two smaller lists of equal size. Two separate threads (which we will term sorting threads) sort each sublist using a sorting algorithm of your choice. The two sublists are then merged by a third thread — a merging thread — which merges the two sublists into a single sorted list.
